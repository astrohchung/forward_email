# forward_email
Conditional Email Forwarding Code

This code forwards a new email which matches with a particular condition to someone.

If someone wants more complex condition (filter) to be applied, please use a filter and email forward functionality in Gmail. Please note that you need a confirmation from the recipient to use that functionality in Gmail (Obviously to prevent automatic spam forwarding to someone else!)

This code is useful in the sense that it does not require the recipient's permission to send the mail. (Please do not abuse this)
